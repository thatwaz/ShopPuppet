### Your First Code Contribution

Not sure where to start? Look for issues labeled `beginner` or `help-wanted`. These are great for first-timers:

- **Beginner Issues**: Typically require only a few lines of code and minimal testing.
- **Help Wanted Issues**: Might require a bit more coding experience but are still manageable.

### Pull Request Process

2. **Add Tests**: If you've added code, try to include tests that cover your changes.
3. **Code Quality**: Ensure your code is clean and commented, and that you've removed any unnecessary files or dependencies.
4. **Document Changes**: If your changes affect how the app is built or used, update the README.md accordingly.
5. **Submit for Review**: Once you're ready, submit your pull request. I'll review your changes and merge them if they enhance the project.
